## Project in Android Development: HW3 - Dry Part
### Question 1
The class that is used to implement the controller pattern in snapping_sheet library is SnappingSheetController.
The features that the controller allows the developer to control are getting the current position and changing the position to a specific other position.

### Question 2
The parameter that controls the behavior is snappingPositions. This is an array of SnappingPosition objects,
each of them defines the snappingCurve parameter that influences the type of the animation after changing position.

### Question 3
An advantage of InkWell over GestureDetector is that the InkWell provides splash effects (such that react to touches with ink splash effects).
An advantage of GestureDetector over InkWell is that the GestureDetector provides more controls (such that dragging).
